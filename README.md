# My Portfolio Website

## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio website! This website serves as a hub to showcase my projects, experience, and skills. It's also a demonstration of my technical capabilities, as I've implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline using various tools like Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, and Firebase.

### Features

· `Projects` : Explore my showcased projects, along with detailed descriptions, images, and links to their respective repositories or live demos.\
· `Experience` : Learn about my professional background, including my work history, education, and certifications.\
· `Contact` : Get in touch with me through the provided contact information.\
· `Blog` : Discover my latest insights and thoughts through my blog section.

### CI/CD Pipeline
#### Technologies Used
· `Jenkins` : I've set up a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process of this website.\
· `SonarQube` : SonarQube is used for code quality analysis and issue detection, ensuring the codebase is of high quality.\
· `Quality Gate` : A quality gate ensures that only code meeting predefined quality criteria can proceed through the pipeline.\
· `Docker` : I've created a Dockerfile to build a Docker image of the website for easy deployment.\
· `Firebase` : The website is deployed using Firebase, making it accessible to users worldwide.

#### CI/CD Workflow

1) Build : Jenkins automatically builds the website whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
2) Test : Automated tests are run to validate the website's functionality.
3) SonarQube Analysis : The code undergoes analysis with SonarQube to identify and report any code quality issues.
4) Quality Gate : The pipeline enforces a quality gate, ensuring that only high-quality code proceeds to the next stage.
5) Docker Image : A Docker image is created from the codebase for portability and consistency.
6) Deployment : The website is automatically deployed to Firebase, making it accessible online.
